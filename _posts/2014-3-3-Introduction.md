Hey! My name is Jonari Ward and I'm from Rock Hill, South Carolina. I'm a double major in Computing in the Arts (Theatre) and Theatre (Performance). 

After graduation, I plan to begin filming and editing videos with artists so I can hone and develop my cinematography skills, along with building a reel. Maybe after a year I will aim for graudate school to further my education.
